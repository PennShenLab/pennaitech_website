### 🎯 Abstract
As part of PennAITech’s efforts to identify AI and technology resources that support caregiving for the aging population, we developed an automated pipeline that integrates classic probabilistic topic modeling with LLM-based methods to surface relevant resources from 2,000+ PubMed entries published since 2011. We also built a website to host these resources and their topic hierarchy, marking the first systematic attempt to assist literature curation in this domain.
